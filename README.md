# roadone30

## This project has been archived
This project is archived, since it does not fit modern standards anymore and has been unnecessarily hard to maintain. A new version, more approprately fitting roadone's needs, is to be made. Tho, it still represents that I have gathered experience building responsive and complex websites and thus the repository has been made public.

## About
**This website is still under construction.**

The group of roadone is a german music group that covers different artists. The website was wished to be monolingual, which is why there is no native translations.<br/><br/>
Vercel hosting public URL: https://roadone-web.vercel.app/<br/>

The website features a custom blog, gigs (being performances by the group), setlist, user authentication and authorization to edit specific parts of the website or post comments and replies under blog posts. ISR is the primary tool of caching entire pages without obstructing the users experience.

Note: due to timing issues integration tests were not implemented.

### Techstack
This project uses the _**NTVP**_ techstack. NextJS, Typescript, Vercel hosting and Prisma. It is made with a completely custom component library, to fit the style and animations required by my own Figma designs.<br/>

### Figma
This project has been sketched by myself through Figma first. The final implementation is not pixel-perfect, since the Figma files were just a guideline with which I knew how to structure my pages.
