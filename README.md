# roadone30
Roadone is a german music group for which I created this page.<br/>
The website features a custom Blog, gigs (being performances by the group), user authentication and authorization to edit specific parts of the website or post comments and replies under blog posts.<br>ISR is the primary tool of caching entire pages without obstructing the users experience.

### Techstack
This project uses the _**NTVP**_ techstack. NextJS, Typescript, Vercel hosting and Prisma. It is made with a completely custom component library, to fit the style and animations required by my own Figma designs.<br/>

### Figma
This project has been sketched by myself through Figma first. The final implementation is not pixel-perfect, since the Figma files were just a guideline with which I knew how to structure my pages.
